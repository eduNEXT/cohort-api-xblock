<div class="cohort_api_xblock_block">
  <p>
    Cohort API used to get information about the student's cohort. To use it,
    just include this xblock in the course and after loading it will emit an
    event with the information about the cohort.

    To get it, you will have to include in your component the following script:

    document.addEventListener("cohort_obtained", (event) => {
        userCohort = event.detail.cohort_name
    });

    For now, we are only sending the name of the cohort.
